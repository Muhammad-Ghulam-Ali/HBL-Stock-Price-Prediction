# HBL-Stock-Price-Prediction
Predicting future stock prices of HBL (Habib Bank Limited) using Linear Regression in Python and Scikit-Learn. Includes EDA, feature engineering, model training, and 3-year forecasting.

## üîç Project Overview
- **Objective**: Predict HBL's stock prices for the next 3 years using historical data.
- **Methodology**:
  - Data preprocessing (handling dates, missing values)
  - Feature engineering (Moving Averages, EMA)
  - Train-test split
  - Model training with Linear Regression
  - Forecasting and visualization
- **Tools & Libraries**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib

## üìÅ Files Included
- `Linear_Regression(HBL).ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook
- `psx_data_2021_to_2024.csv`: Historical stock price data (input)
- `Hbl stock price prediction.csv`: Forecasted prices for the next 3 years
- `Report.pdf`: Project overview
